New features:

* Completely redesigned the pack using [Kenney 1-Bit Pack][1-bit]{:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"}.

* Added option to define player start position per room using tile set metadata.
* Added option to set color of power-up.
* Added option to set player death animation.
* Added option to define enemy fly speed in the Data Table.
* Added option to define projectile scale in the Data Table and Player.

* Greatly reduced package size by scaling and updating textures.
* Replace UI text by images, resulting in a clearer look.
* Focused the correct buttons, so the UI can be navigated by gamepad.
