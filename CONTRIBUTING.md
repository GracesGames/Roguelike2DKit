# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

All forms of contribution are welcome, from project issue reports to pull requests for the website.

Before you open an issue or pull request:

* If you open an issue for the website and are interested in working on a fix, please let us
know. We will help you get started, and it avoid duplicate work.

* Make sure there is an issue open for any work you take on and intend to submit
as a pull request - it helps maintainers review your concept and direction
early and is a good way to discuss what you're planning to do.

* If you're planning to make a major change in a pull request, please ensure
the change is aligned with the project roadmap by opening an issue first,
especially if you're going to spend a lot of time on it.
